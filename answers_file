# RHUI Installer Sample Answers File
#
# This sample answers file can be found at /etc/rhui/answers.sample.
#
# This file is meant to be used as a template for creating an answers file for use with
# the RHUI Installer. Once the appropriate values have been entered, the RHUI Installer
# will generate RPMs based on these values through the following call:
#
#   $ rhui-installer --answers <path to populated answers file>
#
# The results of running the above call will be found in the directory specified in the
# dest_dir attribute under the [general] section.


# == General ===========================================================================

# The [general] section contains configuration options that apply to the RHUI installation
# as a whole.
[general]

# This will be used as the version for all RPMs that are created by this answers file.
# Individual components may override this value with the "rpm_version" attribute.
version: 2.0

# Local directory into which RHUI tools will place any temporary files as well as the
# built RPMs. If this directory exists prior to running RHUI tools, the user executing
# it must have write permissions.
dest_dir: /tmp/rhui

# Full path to the CA certificate used to secure QPID communications. This is generated
# using the nss-db-gen script included with the RHUI Installer.
qpid_ca: /tmp/rhua/qpid/ca.crt

# Full path to the client certificate used to secure QPID communications. This is generated
# using the nss-db-gen script included with the RHUI Installer.
qpid_client: /tmp/rhua/qpid/client.crt

# Full path to the NSS database used to secure QPID communications. This is generated
# using the nss-db-gen script included with the RHUI Installer. Note: This must be
# a directory containing a number of files, including the NSS database and password file.
qpid_nss_db: /tmp/rhua/qpid/nss

# == RHUA ===========================================================================

# The [rhua] section contains attributes describing a particular RHUA instance.
[rhua]

# Name of the RHUA configuration RPM created by RHUI tools.
rpm_name: rh-rhua-config

# Fully qualified hostname of the RHUA instance.
hostname: rhua.example.com

# SSL certificate and private key to be installed on the RHUA. The CN of this certificate
# must match the hostname listed above.
ssl_cert: rhua.crt
ssl_key: /root/gen_certs/server.key

# CA certificate used to sign the RHUA's SSL certificate. This is needed by the CDS
# instances when connecting back to the RHUA to synchronize content to verify the
# RHUA certificate during the handshake.
ca_cert: /root/gen_certs/ca2.crt

# If a proxy server is needed for the RHUA to connect to the internet, this is the hostname
# of that server. If this is not specified, no proxy server will be used.
# proxy_server_host: proxy.example.com

# Port to access on the proxy server. This value has no effect if proxy_server_host is
# not specified.
# proxy_server_port: 443

# Proxy server username. Omit if the proxy server does not require authentication.
# proxy_server_username: admin

# Proxy server password.
# proxy_server_password: password


# == CDS Instances ===========================================================================

# There should be one [cds-*] section for each CDS to be used in the RHUI infrastructure.
# The name between the [ ] must begin with "cds", however the remainder is arbitrary and must
# only be unique with respect to other cds sections. There will be one CDS configuration RPM
# generated for each section found.

[cds-1]

# Name of the RPM that will be created for this CDS configuration.
rpm_name: rh-cds1-config

# Fully qualified name of this CDS instance.
hostname: cds1.example.com

# SSL certificate and private key to be used by this CDS instance. The CN of this
# certificate must match the hostname listed above.
ssl_cert: cds1.crt
ssl_key: /root/gen_certs/server.key

[cds-2]
rpm_name: rh-cds2-config
hostname: cds2.example.com
ssl_cert: cds2.crt
ssl_key: /root/gen_certs/server.key
