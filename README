thanks to sghai for sharing qpid_gen_cert script, which uses expect



1) configure boto.cfg (auto check :need to implement)
2) install argparse

git clone
tar -cvf rhui202_installation.tar ./rhui20tar/
place extract_iso_setup.sh and rhui202_installation.tar in any but same dir
run extract_iso_setup.sh as root, pass <userid> and iso location ( forced to use roor user to mount iso)
the above step will create a rhui20 dir in ~ location(/home/kbidarka/rhui20/, 
move to the ~/rhui20 location and 
run install_rhui_iso.py as the <userid> specified previously , pass region, ami-id

If all good, installation may proceed till rhua and cds rpm creation , distribution and installed stage :)

If all is well, proceed with transfering content_cert and syncing packages. :)
