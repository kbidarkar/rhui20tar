Thanks to sghai for sharing qpid_gen_cert script, which uses expect


a) configure boto.cfg (auto check :need to implement)
b) install argparse, paramiko, boto modules

1) Create security groups as, below. 
Note: The upper and lower case need to precisely  match. 
RHUA Security Group, 
CDS Security Group, 
Client Secuity Group
2) Also enable  port 22, 80, 443, 3128(proxy), 5674(qpid) with source as 10.0.0.0/8 for each Security Group. 

3) run extract_iso_setup.sh as root, pass <userid> and iso location ( forced to use root user to mount iso)
4) the above step will create a rhui20 dir in ~ location(/home/kbidarka/rhui20/,
5) move to the ~/rhui20 location and run install_rhui_iso.py as the <userid> specified previously , pass region, ami-id

6) If all good, installation may proceed till rhua and cds rpm creation , distribution and installed stage :)

7) If all is well, proceed with transfering content_cert and syncing packages. :)

Tried and removed all hardcoded stuff, shout at me if find any hardcoded stuff

The code was written with experimenting many things,
Warning: Code is too stupid at many places, plz ignore:)
Another code with cleaner implementation is already in progress :)
