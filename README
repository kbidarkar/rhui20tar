Thanks to sghai for sharing qpid_gen_cert script, which uses expect

a) configure boto.cfg (auto check :need to implement)
b) install argparse, paramiko, boto

1) tar -cvf rhui202_installation.tar ./rhui20tar/
2) place extract_iso_setup.sh and rhui202_installation.tar in any but same dir
3) run extract_iso_setup.sh as root, pass <userid> and iso location ( forced to use roor user to mount iso)
4) the above step will create a rhui20 dir in ~ location(/home/kbidarka/rhui20/,
5) move to the ~/rhui20 location and run install_rhui_iso.py as the <userid> specified previously , pass region, ami-id

6) If all good, installation may proceed till rhua and cds rpm creation , distribution and installed stage :)

7) If all is well, proceed with transfering content_cert and syncing packages. :)

Tried and removed all hardcoded stuff, shout at me if find any hardcoded stuff

The code was written with experimenting many things,
Warning: Code is too stupid at many places, plz ignore:)
Another code with cleaner implementation is already in progress :)
